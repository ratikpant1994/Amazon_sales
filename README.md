**Black Friday High-Low Spender Prediction**
This project aims to build a predictive model that classifies customers as either high spenders or low spenders based on their Black Friday shopping behavior. By leveraging Python and machine learning techniques, we analyze customer demographics, purchasing patterns, and spending trends to optimize business strategies.

🔑 **Key Highlights**
📊 **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**
Handled missing values using mode imputation.
Encoded categorical variables to make the dataset model-ready.
🏷️ **Customer Segmentation**
**Demographic Analysis:** Analyzed age groups, gender, and marital status to identify spending patterns.
Geographic Insights: Explored the impact of city categories on consumer behavior.
💰 **Spending Patterns**
**High vs. Low Spenders:** Classified customers into high and low spenders based on their total purchase amounts.
**Top Occupations:** Identified occupations with the highest spending tendencies.
Age & Spending Correlation: Visualized spending trends across different age brackets.
🔥 **Machine Learning Model**
**Problem Type:** Binary Classification (High Spender = 1, Low Spender = 0).
Algorithms Used: Explored Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost to optimize predictive performance.
Evaluation Metrics: Used accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to assess model effectiveness.
📈 **Data Visualization**
Created bar charts, pie charts, and heatmaps to illustrate spending trends and customer behavior.
🛠️ **Tools & Technologies**
**Python Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn
**Machine Learning:** Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost
**Data Analysis:** Customer segmentation, trend analysis, predictive modeling
